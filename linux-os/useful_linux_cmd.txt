(1) How to find files or directories of specific names]
Example: Searching for folders (or files) with the name 'pass' from the current folder
$ find . -type d -name 'pass' # This is for folder search
$ find . #type f -name 'pass' # This is for file search


(2) How to searching for patterns (i.e. content) in files
For details refer to:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16956810/how-can-i-find-all-files-containing-specific-text-string-on-linux#:~:text=grep%20%2Drnw%20%27/path/to/somewhere/%27%20%2De%20%27pattern%27
Example: Searching for the pattern 'kind' in from the current directory

$ grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
-r or -R is recursive,
-n is line number, and
-w stands for match the whole word.
-l (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.
-e is the pattern used during the search
Along with these, --exclude, --include, --exclude-dir flags could be used for efficient searching:


(3) How to search for a specific file extensions
Example: Searching for the file extensions .c and .h from the current path
$ grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw . -e "pattern"

NOTE: For directories it's possible to exclude one or more directories using the --exclude-dir parameter. For example, this will exclude the dirs dir1/, dir2/ and all of them matching *.dst/:

grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
This works very well for me, to achieve almost the same purpose like yours.

For more options check man grep.
