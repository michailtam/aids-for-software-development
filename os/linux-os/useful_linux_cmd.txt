(1) How to find files or directories of specific names]
Example: Searching for folders (or files) with the name 'pass' from the current folder
$ find . -type d -name 'pass' # This is for folder search
$ find . #type f -name 'pass' # This is for file search


(2) How to searching for patterns (i.e. content) in files
For details refer to:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16956810/how-can-i-find-all-files-containing-specific-text-string-on-linux#:~:text=grep%20%2Drnw%20%27/path/to/somewhere/%27%20%2De%20%27pattern%27
Example: Searching for the pattern 'kind' in from the current directory

$ grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
-r or -R is recursive,
-n is line number, and
-w stands for match the whole word.
-l (lower-case L) can be added to just give the file name of matching files.
-e is the pattern used during the search
Along with these, --exclude, --include, --exclude-dir flags could be used for efficient searching:


(3) How to search for a specific file extensions
Example: Searching for the file extensions .c and .h from the current path
$ grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw . -e "pattern"

NOTE: For directories it's possible to exclude one or more directories using the --exclude-dir parameter. For example, this will exclude the dirs dir1/, dir2/ and all of them matching *.dst/:

grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,*.dst} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
This works very well for me, to achieve almost the same purpose like yours.

For more options check man grep.

(8) Given two directory trees how to find which files are the same
Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10087571/given-two-directory-trees-how-to-find-which-files-are-the-same
diff -srq dir1/ dir2/ | grep identical
-s  --report-identical-files  Report when two files are the same.
-r  --recursive  Recursively compare any subdirectories found.
-q  --brief  Output only whether files differ.
